I highlight how copying and pasting from external chatbots breaks formatting (tables, lists) and introduces compliance vulnerabilities for enterprises.</p>\n<p><strong>CKEditor AI </strong>is designed to solve these, a new suite of capabilities integrated directly into the rich text editor. Unlike external tools, CKEditor AI is aware of the document model, meaning it preserves complex formatting during generation and editing. The talk outlines three core components of the solution:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>AI Chat:</strong> A context-aware assistant capable of drafting content (e.g., support ticket replies) directly in the editor.</li>\n  <li><strong>Quick Actions:</strong> Pre-configured commands for repetitive tasks like translation, summarization, or tone adjustment.</li>\n  <li><strong>AI Content Review:</strong> A specialized interface similar to \"track changes\" designed to handle high volumes of AI suggestions, ideal for regulatory audits or grammar checks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The talk is concluded by emphasizing that the solution creates a unified, secure environment for content creation that eliminates the chaos of external tools while maintaining enterprise-grade compliance.</p>\n<h2>Abstract:</h2>\n<p>Your content creators, marketers, and support teams are juggling tools. They draft and experiment with content in multiple conversational AI systems. The result is a tedious copy-paste job into your application or internal system, followed by hours spent fixing the formatting that inevitably breaks. For them, it's inefficient. But for you - the founders, the product leaders, the developers - it is a nightmare. This 'Bring Your Own AI' chaos creates security holes, opens you up to compliance risks, and produces content that is inconsistent and often factually incorrect because it lacks critical context. The workflow is fundamentally broken.</p>\n<p>Let’s explore the challenges and opportunities of integrating AI directly into your content creation process. We will touch on how integrating AI into your writing stack can help you:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Boost productivity and alignment\n    <ul>\n      <li>Give your users a unified platform with tailored AI</li>\n      <li>Preserve rich text formatting&nbsp;</li>\n      <li>Get an AI-driven editing experience and review process without friction</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Offload the operational burden\n    <ul>\n      <li>Reduce the workload on AIOps teams</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Keep your product or application compliant and secure</li>\n</ul>\n<p>CKEditor has been the most trusted, robust rich text editor component on the market for over two decades - built for engineers and trusted by Fortune 500 companies. In this talk, we’ll unveil the new CKEditor AI: a suite of configurable components thaxt brings context‑aware generation, predefined quick actions, model selection, and review workflows directly into your rich text editor. Alongside integrated real-time collaboration, you get elevated rich text editing, a productivity boost, and a coherent user experience all in one place.</p>\n<p>Based on research with our customers, we will showcase possible applications of an integrated AI writing stack such as audit reports, translation workflows, or customer service sentiment analysis.</p>\n<p>Join us for this talk to learn more about what you can achieve with the unified AI writing stack</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Read the full recap of CKEditor's experience at the conference here:</strong></p>\n<object type=\"application/kenticocloud\" data-type=\"item\" data-rel=\"component\" data-codename=\"c189b4e7_a90a_0111_41d2_fb16e6e8068d\"></object>","modular_content":[{"system":{"codename":"c189b4e7_a90a_0111_41d2_fb16e6e8068d","type":"button"},"elements":{"icon":{"value":"fa-dev"},"title":{"value":"AI Conference 2025 - CKEditor in da house"},"external_url":{"value":"https://dev.to/ckeditor/ai-conference-2025-ckeditor-in-da-house-m11"},"link_to":{"value":[]}}}],"images":[]}}}},"pageContext":{"language":"en-US","codename":"spark_team_productivity_with_a_frictionless__unifi"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2624379000","2660228588"],"slicesMap":{}}
